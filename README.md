## Description

This project creates a game, in which the user makes pencils, using wood and graphite; increasing the balance, which can then be used to buy more wood and graphite, and also to unlock new levels of the game. It is developed using the QT creator development environment that works with C++ and Object Oriented Programming.

## Features

* Each component of the program is divided into classes that have their own properties that are all used  throughout the game in the game.cpp file. (For example there is a pencil class with proprieties such as number of pencils, price of pencils etc... and throughout the game depending on certain events changes will occur on these values in the game.cpp file).
* Users can put their score in a JSON file that is sent to a server.
* The visuals of the software are managed by the UI component of QT.
* When the project is built 2 programs are generated one that is the game itself and the other one that concerns testing.
